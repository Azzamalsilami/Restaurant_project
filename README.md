# Project Description


This application is a simple restaurant ordering system. It allows a cashier to input custmer name and his phone number, view a menu of food and drinks, select items from the menu, choose whether they want their order for takeout or dine-in, and confirm their order. The system then generates a bill with the customer's information, the order details, and the total price. The bill can be printed if the customer confirms the order and chooses to do so. The application also keeps track of the number of orders placed. The code is written in Java and includes several classes such as customer, menu, order, and bill, each with their own methods and attributes.
